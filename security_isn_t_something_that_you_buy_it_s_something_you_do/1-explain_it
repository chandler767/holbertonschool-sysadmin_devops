1. What should you create? Using what?

You will need to enerate a public/private SSH key pair. On a mac that means that I will use the utility 'ssh-keygen' to generate my keys using the command 'ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096' to create a key with 4096 bits of type RSA.

2. What should you do with the public key? How will it be used? What will it do?

The public key should be placed on the server so I can connect to it. It will be used to authenticate me, when I connect to the server. 

3. What should you do with the private key? How will it be used? What will it do?

Keep it protected on my computer. The private key is used to authenticate me, along with the public key on the server. The private key is basically my password.
